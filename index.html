      <p>I serve as a co-lead of the electrical powertrain division at Western Formula Racing (<i>abrv.</i> WFR). The main goal of the electrical powertrain group this year is to implement a battery for the vehicle. The battery was designed entirely in-house by WFR alumni over the course of 2020 and early 2021 as the focus of their Capstone project.<br /><br />

        As a software engineering student, the battery management system (<i>abrv.</i> BMS) naturally has been of particular interest to me this year. The integral purpose of a battery management system is to passively balance the charge and discharge of lithium-ion battery cells in charging or under load, respectively, to prevent cellular deterioration and the subsequent adverse effects resultant from a short circuit, or unilateral or partially-unilateral under- or over-voltage conditions. The BMS also collects voltage and temperature data, at a cellular level. Additionally, we are currently designing a Kalman filter-based state-of-charge estimation software component, the model of which will utilize each cell’s general characteristics, which will be derived from experimental methods. Leading that front is Maksim Faronov, respected colleague, and WFR’s resident, soon-to-be (!) Doctor of Philosophy in robotics and control systems. Keep up the good work Maksim!<br /><br />
        
        The WFR BMS is designed in a distributed configuration, which is built upon the <b><i>Analog Devices LTC 6820</i></b> and <b><i>6811</i></b> integrated circuits, acting as a Serial Data In/Out (<i>abrv.</i> SDIO) controller and an SDIO peripheral, respectively, in the operation architecture. See this link from the Open Source Hardware Association for more information regarding this Serial Peripheral Interface (<i>abrv.</i> SPI) configuration terminology.<br /><br />
        
        The firmware for the microcontroller operating the BMS controller is written in C/C++. Communication within the battery is done with isoSPI (“iso” means “isolated”), an Analog Devices proprietary communication protocol derivative of SPI that is particularly useful for electrically-noisy applications, like those with high voltages. These environments can produce something called common-mode noise, which basically just interferes with digital signals. It is also beneficial in applications which require isolation for human safety in the case of a short circuit (technical note: isoSPI provides galvanic isolation via the implementation of transformers); both advantages are valuable in the application of electric vehicle racing. Data are then converted to CANBUS-form messages, and outputted from the battery to provide other subsystems throughout the vehicle with battery data.<br /><br />
        
        The battery pack has a maximum pack voltage of 504 volts and an energy density of 241+ watt-hours per kilogram; which, fun fact, is ~29.5% more energy dense than the battery pack of a 2021 Tesla Model X Long Range Plus [1, pp. 15]. </p>

      <h1>Learning a lot?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class = "text-wrapper-body-text">
      <p>Yeah. The process of carrying out the implementation and verification phase of such a deeply-integrated embedded system with minimal prior knowledge has been challenging. However, as with a nice radix sort algorithm, the problem becomes much simpler upon the componentization of it, turning it into a set of smaller subproblems.<br /><br />

        This technique allows each discrete subproblem to be solved more independently of each other rather than entirely dependently of each other, and enhances high-level clarity on the main problem as subproblems are solved; think: jigsaw puzzles. The enhanced clarity naturally catalyzes the formation of a pathway much more substantive relative to that which first appeared, which will be a fantastic guide for what to learn in the more specific context of this current subproblem. As with everything in life and in engineering -- embedded system design, very-large-scale-integration, large software projects, deciding upon a recipe for dinner -- breaking the problem into discrete subproblems is critical in deriving a comprehensive solution.<br /><br />
        
        Also, 2021 brought along a very unique circumstance -- the worldwide, cascading supply chain shortages, particularly affecting the semiconductor and electronics industries! I recently chatted with a partner in industry who told me they saw a part with a lead time extending into Q2 2024, and, as I write this, it is Q4 of 2021. I wish that was a joke.<br /><br />  
        
        Navigating the murky waters of this current market is an ongoing challenge. This far, I have learned that patience and understanding with vendors, sponsors, peers, and third-party businesses goes a lot further than you may initially believe, especially during these increasingly-common, extraneous black swan events. It is very difficult, sometimes, to keep a level-head, but at the end of the day, respect for the fellow human is all we really have in this world. I will update this website with a more extensive introspective when we are out of the thick of it -- good luck with the rest of the tide, embedded engineers!  </p>
